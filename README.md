# Mathlytics

Mathlytics is a web-based platform that provides a set of mathematical and statistical tools for students, analysts, and mathematicians. The project allows users to perform calculations and visualize results without writing any scripts.

## Features

### Matrix Calculator
- Compute determinants, inverse matrices, ranks.
- Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
- Perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication of matrices.

### Statistical Tools
- Calculate mean, median, and mode for a dataset.
- Compute variance and standard deviation.
- Determine correlation between two variables.
- Perform simple linear regression.

### Function Graphing
- Plot functions of one variable.
- Find extrema (maximum and minimum points) of a function.

### Contact Form
- Users can submit feedback or questions directly through the site.
